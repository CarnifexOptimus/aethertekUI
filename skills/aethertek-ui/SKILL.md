description: Build and evolve AethertekUI or adopt it in FFXIV-related C# ImGui applications from approved mockups. Use for library components, layouts, themes, localization, the showcase, and consumer integration; use the optional Dalamud adapter only in Dalamud hosts.

# AethertekUI adoption

Resolve this repository from the skill location (two directories above this
folder), currently `Z:\aethertekUI`. Read its `AGENTS.md` and the consumer's
instructions. This skill guides implementation; it does not authorize edits to
an unselected plugin, client installation, live-game testing or publication.
AutoParty is skipped in the foundation delivery.

## Projects and references

- `src/AethertekUI/AethertekUI.csproj`: core controls, drawing, data helpers,
  cached dark themes and OKLCH palettes; namespace `AethertekUI`. Existing
  component names remain `MaterialTheme`, `MaterialButton`, etc.
- `src/AethertekUI.Dalamud/AethertekUI.Dalamud.csproj`: optional
  `MaterialWindowHost` and host scaling; namespace `AethertekUI.Dalamud`.
- `src/AethertekUI.Demo/`: AethertekUI Showcase, command `/aethertekui`;
  eight native-rendered mock-data pages, including the sizing lab.
- `samples/ConsumerContract/ConsumerUi.cs`: compiled independent example of
  consumer-owned windows, configuration, semantic colors and overlays.

Prefer local `ProjectReference` entries to core, plus the adapter when needed.
For a sibling consumer repository, the core path is typically
`../aethertekUI/src/AethertekUI/AethertekUI.csproj`; resolve the actual path
relative to the consuming csproj. Do not copy library source into plugins.

Core targets .NET 10 / Windows x64 and references `Dalamud.Bindings.ImGui`.
Compatible FFXIV-related C# ImGui applications can use it when they supply that
binding and its matching native runtime/context. Another ImGui binding is not a
drop-in replacement. Reserve the adapter for Dalamud hosts; core does not own
Dalamud services or a renderer.

## Window and control scopes

Cache a `MaterialTheme` or `MaterialThemeController` outside Draw. Rebuild
palettes on seed changes; density, opacity and motion settings reuse them.
Place `MaterialTheme.Push` around the complete native Begin/End lifecycle,
including End when Begin returns false. For Dalamud WindowSystem, wrap
`WindowSystem.Draw` using `MaterialWindowHost.Draw` or `BeginFrame`; a theme
started inside `Window.Draw` is too late for outer-window styling.

`MaterialStyleMode.Compatible` is the default and preserves host layout.
Use `Material` explicitly for a new design that needs full library geometry,
or `ColorsOnly` / `BeginFrame(applyMetrics: false)` for retained overlay geometry.
Scopes are UI-thread/context-bound, lexical and LIFO. Do not copy or double
dispose them, or switch contexts before disposal. Preserve balanced native
Begin/End, popup, table, child, font and ID scopes.

Use Compact density for compact desktop designs, and
`MaterialControls.Push(MaterialControlContext.Toolbar)` or `Dense` for local
rows. `MaterialTable.PushControls()` aligns native and custom table editors.
Enter a control scope after selecting its font. Pass host global scale once.
Explicit component sizes are logical units; measured metrics, native ImGui
coordinates and `MaterialActionTile.Measure` results are already pixels.
Zero/negative sizing conventions vary by component; consult
[adaptive sizing](../../docs/ADAPTIVE_SIZING.md) before choosing fixed widths.

Retain native ImGui editing, focus, navigation, clipping, sorting and disabled
behavior. Consumers configure input/navigation and route any controller events.

## Identity, localization and resources

Keep IDs independent of translated labels. Use persistent model keys in
`PushID`, explicit component `id` arguments, `MaterialOption` keys and reordered
`MaterialSegment.Key` values. Index segment IDs suit fixed lists only. Raw
native controls can separate translated text and identity using `###stable-id`.
Preserve existing internal ImGui IDs during refactors and rebranding.

Measure translated labels using the active host font. Budget pane, column,
button and popup widths for longer translations; use wrapping tiles where
appropriate and check clipped compact labels. Provide tooltips when necessary.
There is no universal fixed width that fits every language. The host supplies
and manages fonts with the required CJK glyphs; the library does not load fonts
or guarantee localization coverage. Test actual host fonts and display scales
when an integration is selected.

Consumers own plugin subscriptions, commands, windows, disposal, configuration
storage, game actions, sorting/filter rules and invalidation. Keep domain status
colors explicit; an accent change must not redefine game status meaning. Fonts
and textures are borrowed and must stay alive through render submission. Do not
dispose host resources from library helpers.

Ship `AethertekUI.dll` beside the plugin and `AethertekUI.Dalamud.dll` when used.
Keep host-owned `Dalamud.dll`, `Dalamud.Bindings.ImGui.dll` and `cimgui.dll` out
of plugin distributions. Dalamud SDK hosts resolve their normal references;
Microsoft.NET.Sdk hosts must resolve the same installed binding/distribution.
Package identities are `AethertekUI` and `AethertekUI.Dalamud`, version 0.3.0;
local package generation is separate from normal build verification.

## Evolve through approved designs

Implement the selected approved mockup faithfully: layout, proportions,
density, hierarchy, interaction and status semantics. When it exposes a missing
component or layout capability, improve AethertekUI and demonstrate the addition
in the showcase. Do not reshape the approved design to fit the current controls.
Retain the MD3-inspired dark/OKLCH foundation while adding capabilities required
by actual integrations. Keep game behavior in the consumer.

Read [component API](../../docs/COMPONENT_API.md) for control signatures and
[integration guide](../../docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for host/data boundaries.
Update this skill as real integrations establish better practices; record
demonstrated guidance, not speculative infrastructure.

## Local verification

Use installed SDK 10.0.201 and the repository-local environment:

```powershell
Set-Location 'Z:\aethertekUI'
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\eng\Build.ps1 -Previews
```

The child process dot-sources `Enter-RepoEnv.ps1` before tooling and leaves
machine/user execution policy unchanged. For direct toolchain commands, enter
that environment in the calling process first. The normal route builds Debug/x64,
runs existing library tests and checks the
independent consumer. Inspect `artifacts/previews/page-0.png` through
`page-7.png` as diagnostic CPU renders of actual native ImGui meshes. They use
a default font and fixed background; GPU compositing and game/CJK fonts require
later host acceptance. Historical mission/GBR reports do not prove current
integration compatibility or grant permission to run legacy tooling.
